Easy AdSense manages all aspects of Google AdSense for your blog: insert ads into posts and sidebar, and add a Google Search box. Easy and complete!

== Description ==

*Easy AdSense* provides a very easy way to generate revenue from your blog using Google AdSense. With its full set of features, *Easy AdSense* is perhaps the first plugin to give you a complete solution for everything AdSense-related.

= Features =

1. Remembers AdSense code and your options by theme, so that you don't have to re-enter them if you play with multiple themes. [This feature provides a solution to Google's unwillingness to let you modify and customize the AdSense code -- you just store all the code variants in your blog database.]
1. Enforces the Google policy of not more than three ad blocks per page.
1. Sidebar Widgets:
* For AdSense for content with custom title.
* For search with customizable text or image title.
* For Link Units.
1. Rich set of Options:
* To put Link Units or Ad Blocks in header or footer.
* To suppress ads on all pages (as opposed to posts), or on the front/home page.
* To add a customizable mouse-over border decoration on ad blocks.
1. Control over the positioning and display of AdSense blocks in each post or page.
1. Simplest possible configuration interface -- nothing more than cutting and pasting AdSense code, and with sensible defaults for the few options present, all with clear instructions.
1. Internationalized (multiple languages supported).

If you feel that these features are a bit too much, consider my lean and mean AdSense plugin [AdSense Now!](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/adsense-now/ "The simplest possible way to AdSense enable your blog")

= What's New in 2.79 =

Updating some translations (`es_ES`, `pt_BR`, `de_DE`)

PS: You'll need a [Google AdSense Account](http://adsense.google.com/).

== Screenshots ==

1. How to set the options for *Easy AdSense*
2. *Easy AdSense* in action - on my own blog.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the *Easy AdSense* plugin (the whole easy-adsenser folder) to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to the Setup -> Easy AdSense and enter your AdSense code and options.
4. Go to Themes -> Widgets to add widgets to your side bar(s).

= Tips =

Although the *Easy AdSense* plugin is designed to handle Google AdSense efficiently, there is nothing preventing you from using the text boxes to place any other kind of text in your blog posts and pages. In particular, you can use ad text from other providers, especially in the header and footer.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The new placement option for lead-in ad block in the header doesn't work the way I like. Can you fix it? =

Short answer: No, I couldn't figure out how to do it better.

Long answer: This option works by adding an action to a hook in WordPress. I could not find a hook that would get activated right after the `<body>` tag in the generated HTML, and right after the header image is placed (and before the sidebars are inserted). If you know the hook names, please let me know. Also, if your theme has "side" bars near the header and footer (north and south sidebars), there may be conflicts between `add_action` hooks resulting in unexpected behavior.

= I get the error "Error locating or loading the defaults! Ensure 'defaults.php' exists, or reinstall the plugin." What to do? =

Please copy *all* the files in the zip archive to your plugin directory. The zip archive `easy-adsenser.?.??.zip` contains the directories `easy-adsenser` and `easy-adsenser/lang`. You need all the files in the `easy-adsenser` directory. One of these files is the missing `defaults.php`. The `lang` directory, on the other hand, is optional and is meant for international users.

= How can I control the appearance of the adsense using CSS? =

All `<div>`s that *Easy AdSense* creates have the class attribute `adsense`. Furthermore, they have attributes like `adsense-leadin`, `adsense-midtext`, `adsense-leadout`, `adsense-widget` and `adsense-lu` depending on the type. You can set the style for these classes in your theme `style.css` to control their appearance.

= Ad Space sharing? =

There is an ad-space sharing scheme implemented starting version 2.5 of *Easy AdSense*, if you would like to support its future development. It gives you an option to share a small fraction of your ad slots to show the author's ads. You can configure this fraction - the default is 5%. (Five percent means my ad would appear roughly once in twenty of your ads). I have extra code to ensure that my ads don't appear more than once on the same page. You can turn off this ad space sharing by entering 0% (starting version 2.57).

Unless you configure the plugin (following the instructions on its admin page) and explicitly turn off the sharing, you agree to run the developer's ads on your site(s). By using the program, the users are agreeing to this condition, and confirming that their sites abide by Google's policies and terms of service.

Starting V2.74, I may use the donated ad slots to display my ClickBank ads (to diversify), because it can co-exist with AdSense. Later on, if there is enough interest, I will release a new plugin (possibly called More Money) for you to monetize using ClickBank and other ad providers.

= Why does my AdSense code disappear when I switch to a new theme? =

One of my motivations in writing *Easy AdSense* was the fact that every time I switched between themes, I had to regenerate the AdSense code to match my new colors. Since I often switched back to the original theme (when I would have to regenerate the code again), I wanted to keep the AdSense code *per theme* in my database. Now, with *Easy AdSense* activated, I can switch among my themes without worrying about the AdSense color mismatch. This is what I meant when I said, "Remembers AdSense code and your options by theme, so that you don't have to re-enter them if you play with multiple themes. [This feature provides a solution to Google's unwillingness to let you modify and customize the AdSense code -- you just store all the code variants in your blog database.]" as the most important feature of *Easy AdSense*.

But this unfortunately means that you do have to set the code *once* whenever you switch to a new theme. I suppose I could have checked your database for some other AdSense code and presented it as defaults, but such complex logic usually results in less robust programs, and pain and suffering down the road.

= Can I control how the ad blocks are formatted in each page? =

Yes! Now, in V2.1+, you more options [through **custom fields**] to control ad blocks in individual posts/pages. Add custom fields with keys like **adsense-top, adsense-middle, adsense-bottom, adsense-widget, adsense-search** and with values like **left, right, center** or **no** to have control how the ad blocks show up in each post or page. The value "**no**" suppresses all AdSense ad blocks in the post or page.

= I find this *easy* plugin too complex with too many options. Any alternatives? =

If you feel that the features of *Easy AdSense* are a bit too much, consider my lean and mean AdSense plugin [AdSense Now!](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/adsense-now/ "The simplest possible way to AdSense enable your blog")

= I just upgraded to WordPress version 2.8. My widget is gone and I'm mad. What gives? =

WP2.8 uses a different widget API. *Easy AdSense* is comapatible with it. Just go to your widget page, and drag and drop it again in the sidebar of your choice at the right point. Fret not, your settings and AdSense code are safely saved (per theme), and you don't have to cut and paste those details again.

= I just activated the plugin. How come I don't see any ads in my blog? =

Note that you have to generate your adsense code from Google, and paste the *entire* code in the text boxes, replacing the existing text. Changing the publisher id alone is not good enough.

If you just created the new Google AdSense code, it may not be active yet. Google takes about ten minutes or so before serving ads. Please try again later.

= I am having a difficult time getting the middle of post ads to show. They show in some posts, but not all of them. Any possible recommendations? =

The middle ads are designed to show up only on long posts (of more than 20 paragraphs). Use the option to force the mid-text ads (in v1.82+) to override this length check.

= How do I report a bug or ask a question? =

Please report any problems, and share your thoughts and comments [at the plugin forum at WordPress](http://wordpress.org/tags/easy-adsenser "Post comments/suggestions/bugs on the WordPress.org forum. [Requires login/registration]") Or send an [email to the plugin author](http://manoj.thulasidas.com/mail.shtml "Email the author").

PS: Plugin author does not endorse any of the translators' websites, nor is he responsible for the contents therein.

A big "Thank You" to all my translators. *Easy AdSense* V2.6+ sports an *Easy Translator* interface that will make the maintenance of translations a breeze. Please take a look (by following the link on the plugin admin page inviting you to improve the existing translation) and update your translations, when you get a chance. This translation interface works only on WP2.8+; please report any issues you encounter so that I can improve it. Thanks!
