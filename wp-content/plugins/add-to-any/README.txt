Individual **service icons** let you optimize your blog posts for specific social sites.  Choose from over 100 individual services.

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How often is the list of services within the menu updated? =

Constantly... and it's done automatically without having to upgrade.

= Where can I choose which button and individual icons to display and other options? =

Go to `Settings` > `Share/Save Buttons`.

= Why isn't the drop-down menu appearing? =

It's likely because your your theme wasn't <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Plugin_API_Hooks" target="_blank">coded properly</a>.  Using the Theme Editor, make sure that the following piece of code is included in your theme's `footer.php` file just before the `</body>` line:

`<?php wp_footer(); ?>`

= How can I move both the button and the individual icons to another area of my theme? =

In the Theme Editor, place this code block where you want the button and individual icons to appear in your theme:

`<?php echo '<ul class="addtoany_list">';
if( function_exists('ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_ICONS') )
	ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_ICONS( array("html_wrap_open" => "<li>", "html_wrap_close" => "</li>") );
if( function_exists('ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_BUTTON') )
	ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_BUTTON( array("html_wrap_open" => "<li>", "html_wrap_close" => "</li>") );
echo '</ul>'; ?>`

= How can I move just the button to another area of my theme? =

Directions are located within the plugin's settings panel located in `Settings` > `Share/Save Buttons` under `Button Placement`. In the Theme Editor, you will place this line of code where you want the button to appear in your theme:

`<?php if( function_exists('ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_BUTTON') ) { ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_BUTTON(); } ?>`

= How can I move just the individual icons to another area of my theme? =

In the Theme Editor, place this line of code where you want the individual icons to appear in your theme (within an HTML list):

`<?php echo '<ul class="addtoany_list">';
if( function_exists('ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_ICONS') )
	ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_ICONS( array("html_wrap_open" => "<li>", "html_wrap_close" => "</li>") );
echo '</ul>'; ?>`

Or you can place the icons as individual links (without being wrapped in an HTML list):

`<?php if( function_exists('ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_ICONS') ) { ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_ICONS(); } ?>`

= How can I force the button to appear in individual posts and pages? =

If your button isn't already set up to appear (it is by default), type the following tag into the page or post that you want the button to appear in: `<!--sharesave-->`

= How can I remove a button from individual posts and pages? =

Type the following tag into the page or post that you do not want the button to appear in: `<!--nosharesave-->`

= Why do embedded objects (like Flash) disappear when the menu is displayed? =

This is done to overcome browser limitations that prevent the drop-down menu from displaying on top of intersecting embedded objects.  If you would like to disable this, uncheck the `Hide embedded objects (Flash, video, etc.) that intersect with the menu when displayed` option on the plugin's settings page.
